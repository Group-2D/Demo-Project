Algorithm.with_db_functionality.py
----------------

To run the timetable generating algorithrim, you currently need to locate the algorithirm.py file and then run file.

Generating a Timetable
-----------------
To generate a timetable, firstly, we recommend population the database (see ref: '_database' and ref: '_Interacting with the System') to prevent errors and to generate the timeable as it requires data from the database. Once you run the algorthirm file, the timetbable will be genrated and stored in the database.
